## Description

In this assignment, the goal was to create a webapp, which received data from a M5 stack with sensors, and displayed that data in real time.
The M5 stack pushes data to a database, which the python application is connected to. The python app then has different functions so it can display the lowest, highest and recent values.
To get live data you will have to log in with a password, and then the JavaScript will update it with live data.
